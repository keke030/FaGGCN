# FaGGCN
FaGGCN is a joint feature-learning and graph-structure-learning framework for multi-omics cancer subtyping: convolutional autoencoders learn survival-guided latent features, while a graph autoencoder plus GCN fuse inter-omics similarities into a comprehensive patient graph for precise classification.
